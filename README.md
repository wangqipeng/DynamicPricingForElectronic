# DynamicPricingForElectronic

Introduction

This project implements a dynamic retail pricing strategy using Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes pricing decisions over time. The goal is to maximize revenue by selecting the best pricing strategy for each product based on market conditions, demand elasticity, and weekday trends.

Solution Overview

The Q-learning agent interacts with an environment where it adjusts product prices and learns from feedback (rewards). The environment simulates consumer demand by considering price elasticity, weekday/weekend effects, and other market factors.

Key Components

Actions - The available pricing options for each product.

States - The conditions that influence pricing decisions.

Reward Function - The metric used to evaluate pricing performance.

Q-learning Algorithm - The reinforcement learning method used to optimize pricing over time.
